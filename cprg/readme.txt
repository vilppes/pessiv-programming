Make a C program consisting of 3 files:
1. conversion.c (contains functions cmToInches and inchesToCm for unit conversion)
2. conversion.h (contains constants and prototypes of functions for above)
3. main.c (main program, prompting user for inches and outputting equivalent values in 2 decimal precision. It should print error message if user provides something which is not a valid floating point number)
makefile:
which has at least the following:
default (just typing will build the program called converter)
combiling .c and .h files to object files (.o) and linking them together to an executable
clean (remove .o files and executable

You should submit just a textfile called programming.txt, which should have your fulln anme e.g. Sandy Student
URL to Github repository where the program codes are
One empty line and reply to the following questions

which programming tools you liked the best?
which programming tools you plan to use in future?
describe optimal use for bash scripts
describe optimal use for python scripts
describe optimal use for c programming language
why makefiles are needed?
